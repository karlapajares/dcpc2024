### Analysis of the diverse business models for digital commons

Despite the digital commons’ benefits, their public good nature raises several challenges mainly related to sustainability and long-term maintenance. The burnout of maintainers, the hype cycles – focusing on the new developments while neglecting older ones – and often unclear business models are among them. The tragedy of the commons is underscored in the high reliance on volunteer developers to sustain it, deviating into underperformance. Even when there is a business model, there are frequent difficulties when searching for funding, especially since larger and more stable projects are prioritized rather than small emerging ones. Therefore, the biggest challenge for digital commons is developing a sustainable type of business model that maintains their independence. The risk of deviating into an asymmetric relationship with their funding stakeholders – usually big tech is the largest contributor – makes the commoners’ community skeptical.

The uniqueness of the digital economy due to the combination of specific characteristics – e.g., information and network externalities, two-sided platforms, experience-nature goods, importance of reputation, etc. – requires tailored business solutions (Eling et al., 2016). To better understand the possible options on how to keep the software open while generating revenue – through monetary or non-monetary resources – the following categorization has been developed:

### Support contracts model (service provision):

It involves providing technical support, maintenance, and consulting services for open-source software. Subscriptions offer expertise to users who need assistance with implementation, customization, or troubleshooting (Chang et al., 2007). It can typically rely on the developer community to leverage non-monetary contributions. For instance, Red Hat enterprise-grade support and services for Linux, or Moodle’s subscription for learning management systems.

**Strengths:**

- Ensures a stable stream, particularly from enterprises.
- Boosts professional adoption and scalability of the service.

**Weaknesses:**

- Limited to users that require advanced or professional services.
- Dependency on enterprise-level clients and requires an existing base of customers.

### Community-based model:

It is based on contributions from a decentralized community of users and developers. This model leverages the ecosystem built around the open-source project where contributors can collaborate, share knowledge, and develop extensions, etc. (Chang et al., 2007). Examples include OpenStreetMap or Apache Software Foundation.

**Strengths:**

- Aligns with open-access principles and promotes wide-scale adoption.
- Relatively low operational costs due to volunteer contributions.

**Weaknesses:**

- Relies heavily on active participation, which can fluctuate.
- Funding is unpredictable unless supplemented by grants or partnerships.

### Freemium:

Providing diverse versions of much the same content under different licenses (split licensing) is another pricing strategy. It offers a free tier of basic features while charging for premium ones (Chang et al., 2007). Timeliness of release, the provision of extras, bundling with products from strategic partners, and search-facilities are among these strategies (Clarke et al., 2007). GitLab or OpenWeather are examples of it.

**Strengths:**

- Encourages massive adoption with free access, attracting diverse groups and can leverage users’ data to price-discriminate them.
- Generates revenue from some users or enterprises needing advanced features while expanding ecosystem integration to create demand for premium products.

**Weaknesses:**

- The conversion from free users to paying ones can be challenging.
- Risks over-relying on premium offerings for sustainability, neglecting the free version and creating tensions in the community.

### Grant-funded model:

It is usually a public-interest focus since it relies on grants from government, NGOs, and/or organizations – usually philanthropic or academic ones – to fund the development and maintenance of the common. Often used to develop large-scale research commons, although mainly digital common infrastructure rather than goods (Chang et al., 2007). Examples are Mozilla Common Voice for language data sets or Decidim sustained by Barcelona’s city council.

**Strengths:**

- Encourages cutting-edge innovation and collaboration without commercial pressures.
- Gives support to long-term and large-scale projects.

**Weaknesses:**

- Limited autonomy and possible dependency on the funders’ priorities or needs.
- Sustainability depends on the availability of external funding.

### Advertising or third-party funding model:

It generates revenue by offering advertising space or leveraging partnerships with third parties to fund services. Revenue can be collected through fees or data-sharing deals, for instance (Chang et al., 2007; Eling et al., 2016). Google Maps API or Mozilla Firefox – that sponsored search engine partnership with Google – are examples of this model.

**Strengths:**

- Maintains accessibility and provides a consistent revenue stream.
- Third-party partnerships can enable innovative integrations.

**Weaknesses:**

- Monetizing users’ data for targeted advertising can raise privacy concerns and may disrupt user experience.
- Sponsors can limit the autonomy and influence their priorities and can delude the community behind the common.

### Conclusion:

Sustainability, accessibility, independence, and community engagement differ across business models. Support contracts provide reliable revenue streams through enterprise-level services but limit accessibility to mass users and risk dependency on commercial clients. Community-based models thrive on volunteer contributions, aligning with open-access principles, yet they face challenges with unpredictable funding and participation. Freemium models attract large user bases by offering free basic features while generating revenue from premium tiers but risk alienating free users if too much focus shifts to paid offerings. Grant-funded models enable large-scale public-interest projects but are vulnerable to donor dependency and constrained autonomy. Advertising or third-party funding ensures broad accessibility but raises privacy concerns and risks compromising independence.

Non-monetary contributions are vital across these models. Thus, volunteer labor, data contributions, knowledge-sharing, and community governance play key roles in sustaining digital commons, particularly in community-based and freemium models.

It is important to consider that digital commons must experiment with different revenue streams while maintaining a free core offering (Eling, et al., 2016). For instance, software-focused commons may benefit from freemium or support contracts, whereas public-interest initiatives often rely on grants. Cases like Red Hat and Mozilla demonstrate the importance of combining multiple revenue models to ensure sustainability while avoiding burnout. Ultimately, balancing openness with innovative funding strategies is essential to maintaining the long-term viability of digital commons.
